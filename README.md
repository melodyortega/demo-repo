To get a C, you need to:
Find an elevator in the apartment/hotel/airport. Only one example for each student.
Take photos of the control interface
Show a gif image of the control interface in operation.
Find the issues with the current design.
Explain why it is good/bad.

# Issues with Current Design
1. In an emergency, you would want to quickly find the emergency button. Should be marked in red.
2. Figuring out what each letter stands for. Many people could not know what each letter stands for
3. Shows a list on each side, how does this help the user figure out which floor to get to?

# To get a B, you need to:
# Think about the common things that you use an elevator. List your most common uses and other more rare uses. Does the interface make doing those common things easier?
# Think about how the user interacts with the elevator. What is the common sequence of actions?
# How does the elevator support the user to figure out how to make it work?

# How does the elevator provide feedback to the user?
Elevator provides feedback to the user by outlining the buttons that have been pressed with a light.

# What are some common mistakes you can make with this current design?
# Suggest the improvements to make on the control interface. Sketch your solution. And justify your design decisions.


Now, imagine that you can have a touch screen on the elevator. To get a A, you need to:
# Come with your design for the touch screen? What is the screen size that you want?
24 inches by 12.5 inches
# Design and implement interactive features
# Design and implement user feedback

You can get extra credits if:
# Your design supports people with disabilities
# You provide extra useful information on the display interface.
# Your imagination ...
